# Zed Scheduler

A simple scheduling tool for the Rutgers Office of Information Technology. Parses CSV Data in Python to fairly schedule Consultants.

Contains several different implementations depending on desired outcomes.

This project was designed as a personal project.

## FAQ

#### Is this project currently in-use?

Unfortunately, due to the preferences of manual scheduling, this project is retired. I may implement more features to better fit the project for the workload as needed.

#### How do I format the CSV files?

The CSV files provided contain headings. Please note that the "priority" section in the schedule data is not in use for the main algorithm because the goal transformed into creating a fair scheduler instead of providing priority to certain consultants.

#### Does this project use any external libraries?

Aside from the CSV and the TimeDate library, no other libraries were used.

#### Why was this project created?

Manual scheduling takes a very long time, so I wanted to provide a prototype to help save some time. This project was retired far before it could reach completion, but perhaps one day it will be implemented in our normal scheduling algorithms.

#### Why was this project retired?

Manual scheduling was preferred because the supervisory and full-time staff have more control over who gets what shift. A full, multi-factoral (and there are a TON of factors) algorithm would take signficant time and resources. At the moment, our current scheduling team is okay with manual scheduling. In the future however, should I be placed on the scheduling team, I am interested in returning to this project.

## Roadmap

- Apply scheduling framework for real consultants.

- Implement algorithm into a deployed WebApp for ease-of-use.
